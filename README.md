## 🧭 About Me

I’m a **Full Stack Engineer** focused on building software that survives beyond demos — under load, over time, and in the hands of real users.

My work lives at the intersection of **product engineering, system design, and developer experience**. I enjoy reasoning about trade-offs, designing clean architectures, and turning ambiguous requirements into predictable, maintainable systems.

I care deeply about **correctness and determinism**.  
If something is fragile or hard to debug, it bothers me.  
If something is boring, predictable, and stable in production — I like it.

- 🇮🇳 Based in India, working with global teams  
- 🧠 Interested in **AI systems, distributed architecture, and DX**
- 🛠 Strong bias toward **clean APIs and simple mental models**
- ✍️ I think in systems, not buzzwords

---

## 🧠 How I Approach Engineering

- Products first, abstractions second  
- Determinism over cleverness  
- APIs are contracts, not suggestions  
- If it’s hard to debug, it’s not done  
- Scale is a design constraint, not a future problem  

I enjoy working across frontend, backend, and infrastructure — especially where decisions in one layer ripple into the others.

## 📓Selected Builds

A record of systems I’ve designed and built — focusing on **real usage, real constraints, and real trade-offs**.

---

### 🔹 Notesight  
**AI Productivity Tool**

Notesight is an AI-powered productivity system built to reduce cognitive overhead around meetings and long-form conversations.

- **Transcript Generation:** Generates accurate transcripts from audio and video using advanced AI pipelines, optimized for real-time and long recordings.
- **Summarization:** Condenses lengthy transcripts into concise, structured summaries without losing context.
- **Actionable Feedback:** Extracts insights, decisions, and follow-ups directly from transcript content.
- **Integrations:** Designed to integrate with calendars and virtual meeting platforms to streamline workflows.

Built with a strong focus on signal over noise — helping users act, not just read.

---

### 🔹 Octa  
**Travel Booking Platform**

Octa is a multi-client travel booking platform built as a complete, production-grade system.

- **Customer App:** Supports cab booking, outstation travel, and hotel reservations.
- **Driver App:** Manages ride requests, navigation, and trip lifecycle in real time.
- **Admin Panel:** Centralized control for bookings, users, pricing, and operations.
- **Architecture:** Designed for concurrency, role separation, and operational visibility.

The focus was on reliability, operational clarity, and scalability across regions.

---

### 🔹 StableJSON  
**Deterministic JSON Processing Toolkit**

A browser-first open source JSON toolkit for developers who care about **consistency and correctness**.

- Canonical JSON output for hashing and comparison  
- Validation, formatting, diffing, and querying  
- JSONPath support  
- Type generation (TypeScript / Zod)  
- Structural analysis and custom validation rules  

StableJSON is intentionally calm, predictable, and dependency-light — built for longevity, not hype.

---

### 🔹 Flowstack  
**Commerce Intelligence Platform**

Flowstack is an **AI-first commerce intelligence platform** designed to help businesses understand and optimize their commerce operations across platforms.

- Unified visibility into products, orders, customers, and vendors  
- AI-assisted insights for sales trends and operational signals  
- Modular backend with clear domain boundaries  
- Multi-user, role-based access control  
- Designed to scale across multiple storefronts and data sources  

The emphasis is on turning raw commerce data into **actionable intelligence**, not just dashboards.

---

### 🔹 AI-First Internal Tools & Dashboards

A collection of internal systems built to support decision-making and operations.

- RAG-based applications for structured knowledge retrieval  
- Admin and analytics dashboards with real-time data  
- Workflow tooling optimized for speed and developer ergonomics  

These projects shaped how I think about **prompt reliability, system boundaries, and failure modes in AI-assisted systems**.
