## 🧭 About Me

I’m a **Full Stack Engineer** focused on building software that holds up outside of demos — under load, over time, and in the hands of real users.

My work sits at the intersection of **product engineering, system design, and developer experience**. I enjoy reasoning about trade-offs, designing clean architectures, and turning ambiguous requirements into reliable, scalable systems.

I care deeply about **correctness, determinism, and maintainability**.  
If something is fragile or hard to debug, it bothers me.  
If something is boring, predictable, and stable in production — I like it.

- 🇮🇳 Based in India, working with global teams  
- 🧠 Interested in **AI systems, distributed architecture, and DX**
- 🛠 Strong bias toward **clean APIs and simple mental models**
- ✍️ I think in systems, not buzzwords

---

## 🧠 How I Approach Engineering

- Products first, abstractions second  
- Determinism over cleverness  
- APIs are contracts, not suggestions  
- If it’s hard to debug, it’s not done  
- Scale is a design constraint, not a future problem  

I enjoy working across frontend, backend, and infrastructure — especially where decisions in one layer ripple into the others.

## 🧩 Selected Projects

### 🔹 StableJSON
A deterministic, browser-first JSON processing toolkit built for developers who care about **consistency and correctness**.

**What it provides**
- Canonical JSON output for hashing and comparison  
- JSON validation, formatting, diffing, and querying  
- JSONPath support  
- Type generation (TypeScript / Zod)  
- Structure analysis and custom validation rules  

**Why it exists**  
Most JSON tools are fragmented, non-deterministic, or over-engineered.  
StableJSON is intentionally calm, predictable, and dependency-light.

Built for longevity, not hype.

### 🔹 Flowstack — Commerce Intelligence Platform
An **AI-first commerce intelligence platform** designed to help businesses **understand, operate, and optimize their commerce stack** across channels.

Flowstack focuses on turning raw operational data into **actionable insight**, not just dashboards.

**Key areas**
- Unified view of products, orders, customers, and vendors  
- AI-assisted insights for sales, operations, and trends  
- Modular backend with clean domain separation  
- Multi-user, role-based access control  
- Designed to scale across multiple storefronts and platforms  

**Tech highlights**
- Node.js backend  
- RESTful APIs  
- MySQL + MongoDB  
- AWS S3 for storage  
- Built with extensibility and long-term evolution in mind  

---

### 🔹 AI-First Internal Tools & Dashboards
- RAG-based applications for structured knowledge retrieval  
- Admin and analytics dashboards with real-time data  
- Workflow tooling focused on speed and developer ergonomics  

These projects sharpened my thinking around **prompt reliability, system boundaries, and failure modes in AI-assisted systems**.
